        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>¼ onion, minced</li>

        <li>¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>¼ pound shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
        Step 1
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Step 2
            Prepare the elbow macaroni according to package directions.
        Step 3
            Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium high heat. 
            Stir in the flour until a cream colored paste forms. Then pour in the 
            milk and stir constantly until this comes to a hard boil, then stir for 
            1 more minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
        Step 4
            When the macaroni is cooked, spread 1/2 of it into the bottom of a 
            lightly greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Then layer 1/2 of the grated onion, 
            1/2 of the salt and pepper and 1/2 of each of the cheeses. Repeat this one 
            more time: macaroni, onion, salt and pepper and cheeses, and then pour the
             reserved white sauce over all. Top off with small pats of butter to taste.
        Step 5
            Cover and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
